# AOOxalates

AOOxalates, short for Amount of Oxalates, is a webapp that people can use to look up the oxalate contents of different ingredients and meals.

## What is an oxalate and why built a webapp for them?

Oxalate is an organic acid found in plants. It has been linked to the formation of kidney stones and is the most common type of kidney stone formed. Besides increasing water intake, kidney stone farmers are usually recommended to decrease their oxalate intakes. There is no simple rule to determine which types of food are low in oxalate - making cooking for people on low-oxalate diets a mission. This difficulty is worsened by several sources giving contracting information about oxalate levels in food.

That is where this app comes ins. It aims to tie together all current research in an easily-searchable form whilst giving results that can be explained and verified from their original sources.

## Usage

[The website can be accessed by clicking this link](https://aooxalates.pythonanywhere.com/)

You can find the oxalate content of all the currently-added foods by typing at least consequtive letters of the food - e.g. typing "app" to search for apples.
